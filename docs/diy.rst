DIY Susy
--------

Susy is built in three distinct modules:
math, output, and syntax.
The math and output layers form the core of Susy â€”
so abstract that they could be used for any grid system.
That's exactly what we hope will happen.

The syntax modules hold it all together.
In the same way that you can theme a website,
applying different CSS to the same markup,
you can theme Susy by writing your own syntax
(or extending one of ours).

We've written a powerful new :doc:`Default Syntax <settings>`,
and we're keeping the old :doc:`susyone/index` available as well.
But why stop there?
You can *create your own unique syntax*,
or port over the language of existing tools like
`oocss`_, `singularity`_, `zurb`_, `neat`_, `zen`_,
`blueprint`_, `960gs`_, etc.,
without ever leaving Susy.
