Susy Documentation
==================

`Susy`_: *A custom layout toolkit.*

The world is full of overblown, one-size-fits-all `"frameworks"`_
that want to design your site for you.
We think the best layout is the one you custom-build
around your own content,
with your markup, to fit your design.
We just help you with the math.

The only requirement is `Sass`_,
but all the cool kids load `Compass`_,
and we recommend something like `Breakpoint`_
to help manage your media-queries.
