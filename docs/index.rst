Manifesto
=========

The world is full of overblown, one-size-fits-all "`frameworks`_"
that want to design your site for you.
We think the best layout is the one you custom-build
around your own content,
with your markup, to fit your design.

That's why we built `Susy`_
(pronounced like Suzy),
a non-invasive and un-opinionated
layout toolkit:
designed to be flexible, semantic,
simple, and responsive.
We're not here to tell you
about the magical powers of the golden-ratio,
or where to use ``em`` vs ``px``,
we just don't like doing the same math over and over.
Let Susy do the math, so you can focus on design.

ToDo
----

These are the features we're working on next:

- Add optional ``px`` fallback for output in ``rem`` units.
- Respect Compass support settings when they are available.
- Port Susy 1 syntax to use new math and Sass features.
- Add upgrade syntax to help with the transition.
- Add padding/margin options to the ``span`` mixin, for simpler output.

We're always happy to hear your ideas as well.
