Susy Documentation
==================

`Susy`_ is a Sass toolkit for creating custom, responsive layouts.
You don't need one more person telling you how to do your job.
The world is full of bosses and clients and overblown "grid frameworks"
that think they know how your layout should work.
We think the best layout is the one you custom-build around your content,
so we've created a toolkit to help you do that.
Your markup, your design, your layout:
we just help you with the repetative parts.
