Susy is built in three distinct modules:
math, output, and syntax.
The math and and output layers form the core of Susy,
so abstract that they could be used for any grid system,
and that's exactly what we hope will happen.

The syntax modules hold it all together,
defining the specific tools
that can be swapped out to match your needs.
In the same way you can theme a website,
applying different CSS to the same markup,
you can theme Susy by writing your own syntax,
or adapting one of ours.

We've written a powerful new syntax that we're very proud of,
and we'll be making the old Susy syntax available as well,
but why stop there?
You can create your own unique syntax,
or extend the language of existing tools like
`oocss`_, `singularity`_, `zurb`_, `neat`_, `zen`_,
`blueprint`_, `960gs`_, etc.,
without ever leaving Susy.
