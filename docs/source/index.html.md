This is not another one-size-fits-all grid framework 
that will make your sites look identical 
and litter your markup with meaningless "col2of5" jargon. 
Susy's not a framework, it's a power-tool.

Stop assembling prefab houses, and start designing your castle.

## Melts in your mouth

The web is a responsive place, 
from your lithe & lively development process 
to your end user's super-tablet-multi-magic-laptop-phone. 
You need grids that are powerful, but custom. 
Reliable, but responsive.

Susy grids are fluid on the inside, 
ready to respond at any moment, 
but contained in the candy shell of your choice, 
so they respond how and when and where you want them to.

## Everywhere you want to be

Susy is based on Natalie Downe's [CSS Systems][sys], 
made possible by [Sass][sass], and made easy with [Compass][compass]. 
You can use it anywhere,
from static sites to python/django, ruby/rails, and php/wordpress. 
With [SMACSS][smacss] or [OOCS][oocss], [Bootstrap][bs], 
[HTML5 Boilerplate][html5bp], or [320 and up][320]. 
It even comes packaged as part of [Middleman][mm], to make your life easy.
